# Stat228 - FinalProject

This repository contains my Stat 228 final project about following the entire data science pipeline in R to tell a story.

## Goals
By completing this project, you will demonstrate that you are proficient in the core components of the data science pipeline, including your ability to:
- Formulate a clear, meaningful research question that can be addressed with data
- Identify and apply appropriate data wrangling techniques to prepare data for analysis
- Explore and visualize the data to gain insights and identify patterns
- Implement a statistical or modeling method that provides insight into your research question
- Interpret and evaluate the results of your analysis, connecting them back to your question and highlighting key takeaways
- Assess the strengths and limitations of your approach, and propose ideas for future extensions
- Communicate your full process through a written blog post, an oral presentation, and updated data science portfolio

## Finer details
You’ll write an R Markdown blog post that includes the following sections. (You don’t have to use these specific section titles, but make sure it’s easy for the reader to follow along and navigate to sections they’re most interested in.)
- Title: a short, clear, and ideally engaging title for your post.
- Introduction: introduce the dataset and clearly state your research question or problem. Provide relevant context to help the reader understand the motivation behind your project.
- Data import and wrangling: show how you imported, cleaned, transformed, and explored the data. Include a mix of code and narrative explanation.
- Data visualization: include at least one well-crafted, clear, and informative data visualization that helps communicate a key part of your analysis. You are encouraged to use multiple visualizations as appropriate, but each should be purposeful and thoughtfully designed.
- Modeling/analysis: apply an appropriate statistical or modeling method to answer your question. This could include techniques we discussed in class such as logistic regression and decision trees, or something you’ve learned outside of class. Describe your approach, justify your method, and explain the results. Create something that is insightful and well-crafted.
- Conclusion/discussion: summarize your key findings. Reflect on what your analysis revealed, any limitations, and possible next steps.
- References: cite your dataset(s) and any external sources. Any consistent reference format is fine.
